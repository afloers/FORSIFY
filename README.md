# FORSify - automatic data reduction of ESO VLT / FORS2 observations



# Requirements

(see `FORSify/requirements.txt`)

* python
* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* astropy
* ginga
* h5py
* future
* PyYAML
* linetools
* IPython
* scikit-learn
* configobj
* pypeit

# Installation instructions
You can install the necessary packages and the pipeline by running
the following commands in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/afloers/FORSIFY.git
cd FORSify
conda env create -n forsify --file FORSify/requirements.txt
conda activate forsify
pip install spectres
python setup.py install
```

Then, install spectres manually:
```console
foo@bar:~$ pip install spectres
```

# Usage
See all FORSify options by running the following command in your terminal:
```console
foo@bar:~$ FORSify -h
usage: FORSify [-h] -r ROOT [-c {1,2}] [-b BIAS] [-f FLAT] [-s SOURCES] [-v VERBOSITY] [-o] [-a]

Script for running FORSify

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r ROOT, --root ROOT  Raw data directory
  -c {1,2}, --chip {1,2}
                        FORS detector ccd number; can be [1,2].
  -b BIAS, --bias BIAS  Specifies whether bias frames are used or not. The default is True.
  -f FLAT, --flat FLAT  File type of flat field images. Can be any combination of ["illumflat", "pixelflat", "trace"]
  -s SOURCES, --sources SOURCES
                        Maximum number of sources to model/extract. An arbitrary number of sources can be specified with '0'.
  -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity VERBOSITY
                        Verbosity level between 0 [none] and 2 [all]
  -o, --overwrite       Overwrite any existing files/directories
  -a, --archival        If True, use archival calibration data instead.
```
For standard reductions, only two options are important:

`-r` indicates the raw data folder with respect to your current working directory.

If `--archival` is set the pipeline uses archival calibration frames for the reduction. In this case, only the science frame needs to be placed in the raw data folder.

# Output
FORSify reduces and fluxes the science frames automatically. Fluxing is performed using a sensitivity function created from all standard stars of the corresponding semester using the same setup as the science frame.

Output files are given both in the pypeit and iraf format. Iraf output files are given in the `Output` directory, whereas pypeit output files are found in the standard `Science` directory.
